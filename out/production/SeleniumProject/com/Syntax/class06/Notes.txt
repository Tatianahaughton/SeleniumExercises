Alerts:
1.Web-based(html) alerts-inspect and deal with them in a regular manner
2.JavaScript alert-We cant  those alert. We use alert interface: when it appears we switch by d
Alert x=river.switchTo.alert();
We can accept(),
dismiss(),
sendKeys,
getText();

Frames:
1.We deal with them by switching frames NOT directly from main page:
driver.switchTo.frame();
Then deal with that frame.
Techniques to switch:

1.By index;
2.By name or ID--> the name and id in the tag "as an attribute" <iframe anme="frame1", id="abc";
3.By WebElement:
a.Find xpath in the frame
b.driver findElement(xpath)
c.driver.switchTo.frame(WebElement)
